Simple Photobooth with RaspberryPi

Created for a party, not a commercial project. 

Entry point: photobooth.py

WARNING: The code, by design, deletes all JPG images on your camera's SD card at startup. This is done to speed up the capture-and-download process and ensure that the only images on the camera are ones taken at the photo booth.
